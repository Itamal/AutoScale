AUTOSCALE is an experiment in creating dynamic music scaling.
User defines first key to start with;
Chooses harmonic ratios (not working for now);
Chooses the scale steppe (the first number being the number of octaves that the span relates to, the second the amount of intervals in the span)

Then the user must load the data to the system and can then either autogenerate a 8 step up & down scale or play the dynamic piano

Uses Tone.js

CIRCLE is an experimental UX to explore the ratios differences of music
